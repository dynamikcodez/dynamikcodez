# Hi, I’m Iyiola 👋🏾

I’m a builder, writer, and experimental technologist exploring how **XR, web, and storytelling** can be used to create practical tools, learning experiences, and digital products — especially in emerging markets.

I like turning **rough ideas into clear prototypes**, and learning in public as I go.

## 🧠 Interests
- Augmented Reality (AR) & XR for education, commerce, and navigation  
- Web-based products and MVPs  
- Human-centered product and systems thinking  
- Writing (essays, concepts, prompts, narrative ideas)  
- Building useful things with limited resources  

---

## 🛠️ What I’m Working On
- Web-based AR experiments (marker & markerless)
- Product concepts around navigation, interiors, learning, and discovery
- Writing and publishing long-form thoughts
- Small tools, demos, and exploratory prototypes

> Many projects here are **experiments**, not finished products — the goal is learning, testing, and iteration.

## 🧩 How I Build
- Start small, ship early  
- Favor clarity over complexity  
- Design for people before platforms  
- Learn in public

- AR.js, WebXR, and lightweight 3D workflows  
- Product storytelling & positioning  
- Better writing through structure and constraint
